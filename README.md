To assess skills in molecular modeling, we provide two tasks:

Practical Task: Focused on the basics of molecular modeling, this task (in the attachment) takes 2â€“4 hours, depending on programming proficiency.
Theoretical Task: Involves exploring path sampling methodology, presenting it clearly, and analyzing a scientific paper with its underlying math and physics.
These tasks aim to evaluate problem-solving abilities and deepen understanding of molecular modeling.
